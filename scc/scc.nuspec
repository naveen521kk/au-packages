    <summary>Sloc, Cloc and Code: scc is a very fast accurate code counter with complexity calculations and COCOMO estimates written in pure Go </summary>
    <description>
	## Sloc Cloc and Code (scc)
	A tool similar to cloc, sloccount and tokei. For counting physical the lines of code, blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.

	Goal is to be the fastest code counter possible, but also perform COCOMO calculation like sloccount and to estimate code complexity similar to cyclomatic complexity calculators. In short one tool to rule them all.

	Also it has a very short name which is easy to type scc.
