    <summary>A community-maintained Python framework for creating mathematical animations.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/changelog.html</releaseNotes>
    <description>Manim is an animation engine written in Python primarily used to create explanatory math videos such as those of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). It allows for the creation of precise animations programmatically. For more info, [see the GitHub repo](https://github.com/manimcommunity/manim).

This package aims to simplify the historically painful process of setting up Manim on Windows. After installation you can execute your animation scripts with `manim &lt;file&gt;.py`.

**NOTE:** This package  installs the [community version](https://github.com/manimcommunity/manim) of manim, which is different from https://github.com/3b1b/manim, mainly because it is developed by a team of volunteer developers. This software is currently under development and may be out of date, unstable, buggy, or not even run at all when installed.

This **installs** manim using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) with its dependencies.

**NOTE:** This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
